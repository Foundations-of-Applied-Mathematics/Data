he said let's get out of this town drive out of the city away from the crowds
i thought heaven can't help me now
nothing lasts forever but this is gonna take me down
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams ah-ha
i said no one has to know what we do his hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room and his voice is a familiar sound
nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad but he does it so well and when we've had our very last kiss
my last request it is
say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset babe red lips and rosy cheeks say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams ah-ha
you see me in hindsight tangled up with you all night burning it down
someday when you leave me i bet these memories follow you around
you'll see me in hindsight tangled up with you all night burning it down
someday when you leave me i bet these memories follow you around
say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
red lips and rosy cheeks say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams
looking at it now it all seems so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember you took a polaroid of us then discovered the rest of the world was black and white but we were in screaming color and i remember thinking are we out of the woods yet
are we out of the woods yet
are we out of the woods yet
are we out of the woods
are we in the clear yet
are we in the clear yet
are we in the clear yet
in the clear yet
good
are we out of the woods
looking at it now last december we were built to fall apart then fall back together
your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget when we decided to move the furniture so we could dance baby like we stood a chance
two paper airplanes flying flying flying
and i remember thinkin'
are we out of the woods
remember when you hit the brakes too soon twenty stitches in the hospital room when you started cryin' baby i did too but when the sun came up i was lookin' at you
remember when we couldn't take the heat i walked out and said i'm settin' you free but the monsters turned out to be just trees and when the sun came up you were lookin' at me
you were lookin' at me
i remember oh i remember
people like you always want back the love they gave away and people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
the more i think about it now the less i know
all i know is that you drove us off the road
stay
hey all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand then why'd you have to go and lock me out when i let you in
hey now you say you want it back now that it's just too late
well it could've been easy all you had to do was stay
all you had to do was stay
all you had to do was stay
all you had to do was stay

here you are now calling me up but i don't know what to say

people like you always want back the love they pushed aside
but people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

i would wait forever and ever
and that's how it works

clear blue water high tide came and brought you in and i could go on and on on and on and i will
skies grew darker currents swept you out again and you were just gone and gone gone and gone
in silent screams in wildest dreams i never dreamed of this
this love is good 
this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
tossing turning struggled through the night with someone new and i could go on and on on and on
lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you
but you're still gone gone gone
been losing grip oh sinking ships
you showed up just in time
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
your kiss my cheek i watched you leave
your smile my ghost i fell to my knees
when you're young you just run but you come back to what you need
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me
you stand with your hand on my waist line
it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame it could burn out
cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places
lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time 
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places 
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love
baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places
they take their shots but we're bulletproof
i know places and you know for me it's always you
i know places
in the dead of night your eyes so green
i know places and i know for you it's always me
i know places
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth
you're still all over me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
said i think i am finally clean
10 months sober i must admit just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older i won't give in
now that i'm clean i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
think i'm finally clean
